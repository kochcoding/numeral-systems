# Convert numbers from different numeral systems into one another

With this project I want to save time for university. I didn't want to convert the numbers by hand anymore but I needed the calcutlating way.
So after programming this page I am pretty good at transforming numbers into different numeral systems and I don't spend much time anymore doing this
in way to many exercises
